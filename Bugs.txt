The list of bugs I believe there are.

IsEmpty works only for empty lists, I believe that it just returns true.

AddBack seems to work as AddFront should.

I do not believe RemoveBack does anything. The Vector before and after removal were the same.

RemoveFront is broken, but it does remove one element. Probably is broken because isEmpty is also.
